# TypeScript Fundamentals

## #1 Goal for this repo
By the end of this, I want to have a rock solid mental model, that will serve me well for years

## #2 What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is an **open source**, typed syntactic superset of **JavaScript**

- Compiles to readable JS
- Three parts: Language, Language Server and Compiler
- Kind of like a fancy linter

## #3 Why TypeScript?

- It allows you, as a code author, to leave more of your intent “on the page”
- It has the potential to move some kinds of errors from runtime to compile time
- It serves as the foundation for a great code authoring experience
